Asteroids
=========

Asteroids by young JR. Written long long (int ;)) time ago, when jquery 1.8 was a thing. This has no dependencies except jquery. Physics and graphic rendering are written from scratch.

Original title was "pomi≈Ñ opory ruchu" which is something like "neglect movement resistance" - a phraze often used in phisics workbook questions.

Technicaly it's poor code. I've got little expirinece when writing it. Variable names are mostly in polish. I didn't know how to git when I was writing it, so amount of "that may be needed later" comments is big.

Maybe I'll clean this later. Maybe.
